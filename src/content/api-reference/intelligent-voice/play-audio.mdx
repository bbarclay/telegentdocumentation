### Python Example (Playing Text-to-Speech)

```python
import requests

call_id = "call_12345abcde"
url = f"https://api.telegent.com/voice/calls/{call_id}/play"

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "Text": "Your call is important to us.",
    "Voice": "female",
    "Target": "both"
}

try:
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for bad status codes

    play_status = response.json()
    print("Play Action Status:")
    print(f"Call Id: {play_status.get('CallId')}")
    print(f"Message: {play_status.get('Message')}")

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error initiating play action: {e}")
    if response is not None:
